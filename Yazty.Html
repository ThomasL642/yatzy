        <h2>Yahtzee Rules</h2>
        <p><strong>The objective of YAHTZEE</strong> is to get as many points as possible by rolling five dice and getting certain combinations of dice.</p>
        <h3>Gameplay</h3>
        <p>In each turn a player may throw the dice up to three times. A player doesn't have to roll all five dice on the second and third throw of a round; they may put as many dice as they want aside and only throw the ones that don't have the numbers they're trying to get. For example, a player throws and gets 1,3,3,4,6. They decide to try for the large straight, 1,2,3,4,5, so they put 1,3,4 aside and only throw 3 and 6 again, hoping to get 2 and 5.</p>
        <p>In this game, you click on the dice you want to keep. They will change color and will not be thrown the next time you press the 'Roll Dice' button. If you decide after the second throw in a turn that you don't want to keep the same dice before the third throw, then you can click them again, and they will move back to the table and be thrown in the third throw.</p>
        
        <h3>Upper Section Combinations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ones:</strong> Get as many ones as possible.</li>
            <li><strong>Twos:</strong> Get as many twos as possible.</li>
            <li><strong>Threes:</strong> Get as many threes as possible.</li>
            <li><strong>Fours:</strong> Get as many fours as possible.</li>
            <li><strong>Fives:</strong> Get as many fives as possible.</li>
            <li><strong>Sixes:</strong> Get as many sixes as possible.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The score for each combination above is the sum of the relevant dice. If the sum of all these combinations is 63 or more, the player gets a bonus of 35 points.</p>

        <h3>Lower Section Combinations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Three of a kind:</strong> Get three dice with the same number. Points are the sum of all dice.</li>
            <li><strong>Four of a kind:</strong> Get four dice with the same number. Points are the sum of all dice.</li>
            <li><strong>Full house:</strong> Get three of a kind and a pair, scores 25 points.</li>
            <li><strong>Small straight:</strong> Four sequential dice, scores 30 points.</li>
            <li><strong>Large straight:</strong> Five sequential dice, scores 40 points.</li>
            <li><strong>Chance:</strong> Any combination, scores the sum of the dice.</li>
            <li><strong>YAHTZEE:</strong> Five of a kind, scores 50 points.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Multiple Yahtzees</h3>
        <p>The rules for multiple Yahtzees involve specific cases:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>If you already have a Yahtzee:</strong> You get a 100-point bonus in the Yahtzee box and a "joker," allowing you to choose another move.</li>
            <li><strong>If you put 0 in the Yahtzee box:</strong> No 100-point bonus, but you still get a joker.</li>
        </ul>
